# moodle_annulabLRS
This block for Moodle gives access to a user’s own historical data sent by the moodle logstore_xapi and tincanlaunch plugins to the LRS of Annulab in a graphical format and data table.  It requires a free subscription at http://lrs.annulab.com.  The LRS enables anyone who is connected to import his/her own data in a JSON format file archived into a ZIP file.
